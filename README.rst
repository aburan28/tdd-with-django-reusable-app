Test Driven Development with Django Reusable Apps
=================================================

This is the code for my talk at PyCon APAC 2012 about test driven development
with Django reusable apps.

There is another repository that covers the code for Django projects:
https://github.com/mbrochh/tdd-with-django-project

This is an example repository structure that should show how you can layout a
Django reusable app so that if fulfills the following criteria:

* is ready for test driven development
* can be tested on travis.ci.org
* can be uploaded to the Python package index
